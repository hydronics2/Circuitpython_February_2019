# CircuitPython

I uploaded the above python scripts onto your Adafruit M0 board.  It also has a tiny 2mb flash chip that helps store all these files. When you plug the unit into your board it appears as a flash drive.

Download and install the [MU editor](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor) if you have not done so already.
