# CircuitPython

I uploaded the above python scripts onto your Adafruit M0 board.  It also has a tiny 2mb flash chip that helps store all these files. When you plug the unit into your board it appears as a flash drive.

Download and install the [MU editor](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor) if you have not done so already.

## code.py
LOAD the code.py script. Code.py determines which scripts run. Uncomment the files you would like to run.

## a1_blink_digital_out_example
LOAD the a1_blink.... script that's currently running. It blinks the LED on pin 13. An internal LED also blinks. Try blinking the other LEDs on pins A1 and A2.
