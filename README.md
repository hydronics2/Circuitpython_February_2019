# Circuitpython_February_2019
This is a soldering and programming class in Circuitpython

This class occurs in two parts -- Soldering and Programming.

We'll be soldering a custom printed circuit board with a few headers and parts.  
Once complete we can connect the Adfruit development board (an [ItsyBitsy M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727)).
It shows up as an external hard drive with pre-loaded example scripts.
