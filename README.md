# Circuitpython_February_2019
This is a soldering and programming class in Circuitpython

github.com/hydronics2/circuitpython_february_2019

This class occurs in two parts -- Soldering and Programming.

We'll be soldering parts and headers  onto a custom printed circuit board(PCB).  
Once complete, the Adfruit development board (an [ItsyBitsy M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727)) sockets onto the PCB female headers.
Connecting the Adafruit M0 to your computer it shows up as an external hard drive with pre-loaded example scripts.
